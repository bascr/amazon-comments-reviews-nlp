      "There appears to be conflicting info online as to whether this USB charging port assembly also contains the Nexus 4 microphone. Well, it does. As with another reviewer, after installing this replacement part, the microphone did not work. I have contacted the seller (in my case, \\\\\"JM Int'L_Ships From Chicago\\\\\") and will update my review and rating as soon I know more.<br /><br />For reference, in the product's pic on this page, see the small black square just to the left of the USB port. The microphone is a small metal \\\\\"chip\\\\\" that is on the reverse side of the circuit board underneath that black square; the black square appears to be a small piece of mesh over the microphone opening (a small pinhole in the circuitboard); this small piece of mesh joins up to a rubber part on the Nexus 4 housing, that leads to the microphone opening on the bottom edge of the outside of the phone.<br /><br />UPDATE JUNE 2014:<br /><br />I have changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars after receiving a replacement unit from the seller, \\\\\"JM Int'L_Ships From Chicago\\\\\" (fyi, it appears JM Int'l is also the parent company to related vendors ePartSolution and eRepairSolution). It took a few back and forth emails with them over a few days (always courteous though) to establish that my part was defective and not damaged during install, and I was very pleased when they sent me a replacement at no additional cost. The replacement works great: microphone and charging/data port.\t4\n",

I wasn't sure about the &#34;High Definition&#34; claim but I can confirm that it really is crystal clear.  Installation couldn't have been any easier.  Simply steam up a bathroom to force dust particles out of the air and you won't have single spec of dust between the protector and the screen.<br /><br />One star was taken off simply because the fit could be improved slightly.  The protector is just a little smaller than the screen (which is better than being too large) but this does leave a small (1mm) gap around one side and the top/bottom.<br /><br />Overall, I will happily buy more iSmooth screen protectors for future devices.\t4\n",

The finish feels great, it fits the phone perfectly, and it doesn't add bulk.  It looks and feels like a top-quality product.  I had tried a different [[ASIN:B00F1U2WQY case]] but it was bulky and felt cheap.<br /><br />It's hard to find a good quality case for relatively low-end phones like the F3.
